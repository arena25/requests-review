* Thesis: Identification happens in both writing/reading and computer
  programming. They make use of some of the same techniques to achieve it.

* Clear communication is required. 
** Grammar and punctuation and sentence structure matter. Style.
  
** Code has style, too. (Look at Requests source.) Variable names. Comments. Documentation.
    
* Both achieve identification by navigating complexity.

** Identification happens in the midst, in spite of, complexity. Trivial
    identification isn't interesting.

** Books: complexity of reality, meaning of life.

** Programming: complexity of code.
    
* Identification happens when expressive power is harnassed to communicate on multiple levels simultaneously.

* Identification via a deliberate happens by habitation of other minds. Act of writing and of programming call for creator to step into someone else's shoes. Very difficult.

* Conclusion: Identification happens in both writing/reading and computer programming.
